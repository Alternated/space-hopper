No known bugs as of late.

Potential Future Enhancement: More visual representation and indicator for the main menu button in the levels and the mute button in the menu. Level 3 could be made harder with more visual representation.

### Self Reflection:
I did not have the time to do touch ups on the visual indicator that applies to the mute button in the main menu, and to adjust the invincible blocks in the 3rd level. These should be given indicators, as well as a more challenging touch up to level 3. The game play was perfectly viable, but there was a sense of lag coming from the game, due to it being in 30 fps. I already fell behind in schedule finishing block breaker at the second last week. Making sure I don't fall behind again, I should have given myself more time to complete all the projects necessary. During development, there was a problem with the background music continously playing without stopping at a specific scene. To solve that problem, codes were added to destroy the game object that was playing music in order to terminate repetition. I wished I knew how to add coding for movement for my game before coding it, as this is the more experimental side that has to be done multiple times to get right.
